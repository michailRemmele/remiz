# AGENTS.md — dacha monorepo

## What this is

One repository holding two npm packages:

- **[packages/dacha/](packages/dacha/)** — **dacha**, a JavaScript/TypeScript game engine
  for browser games, published as `dacha`. Rendering is built on **pixi.js 8**. The engine
  is data-driven: a game is described by a JSON-like `Config` (scenes, actors, templates,
  systems, global options) which the engine bootstraps into a running world.
- **[packages/dacha-workbench/](packages/dacha-workbench/)** — **dacha-workbench**, the
  GUI editor for that engine, published as `dacha-workbench`. An **Electron + React 18**
  desktop app with a `dacha-workbench` CLI bin. It depends on `dacha`.

The editor ships in two forms: **an app** (the Electron editor a game developer runs
against their project) and **a library** (the ESM exports `dacha-workbench` and
`dacha-workbench/decorators`, which game projects import to describe their custom
components and systems to the editor).

The two packages were separate repositories until 2026-08-16 and are now one, with both
histories preserved. Versions are **lockstep** — `scripts/release.js` gives both packages
and the editor's `dacha` devDependency the same version. They differ only until the first
release from the monorepo.

## Commands

All day-to-day commands run from the **repository root**:

```bash
npm run build        # tsc -b (both packages) + webpack app build for the editor
npm run clean        # remove all build output and incremental state
npm test             # tsc -b (via pretest), then Jest in both packages
npm run test:e2e     # build, pull screenshot baselines, run the Playwright suite
npm run lint         # eslint across the whole repo — there is no package-level lint
npm run dev          # tsc -b --watch + the editor's dev server, together
npm run pack:local   # build and produce installable .tgz archives in packs/
npm run release <v>  # preflight, lockstep version bump, publish, tag, push
```

**End-to-end tests** live in `packages/dacha-workbench/e2e/` (Playwright, `_electron`
launcher — it starts Electron on `index.js` against the production webpack build over a
throwaway copy of `fixture/`, so `npm run test:e2e` builds first). Specs
split by test title into functional and screenshot (`test('screenshot: …')`) groups,
selected in CI with `--grep`/`--grep-invert "screenshot:"`; screenshot baselines are not
committed but synced from S3-compatible storage by
`scripts/e2e-baselines.js` (pull/push). **Locally you must load the profile first —
`source .env.local`** (repo root, gitignored): it exports `AWS_PROFILE`, `S3_ENDPOINT`,
`S3_BUCKET` and the two `AWS_*_CHECKSUM_*` compatibility vars the baseline sync needs, plus
`S3_DOCS_PROFILE`/`S3_DOCS_BUCKET` for the documentation media (see below). CI
sets the baseline variables from repo secrets. The functional group alone needs no S3 access:
`npx playwright test --config e2e/playwright.config.ts --grep-invert "screenshot:"` from
inside `packages/dacha-workbench/`.

`pack:local` stamps every archive with a unique local version
(`x.y.z-local.<timestamp>`) by rewriting `package.json` **inside the tarball**,
never in the working tree — otherwise npm treats a reinstall of the same version as a
no-op and the test project keeps the old code. Pass `--to <project>` to install into a project directly.

**Documentation media.** The docs site's video lives in a second, **public** S3 bucket
rather than in git — the clips are megabytes each and are replaced wholesale. The site
links to them by absolute URL built from `MEDIA_BASE_URL` in
`packages/dacha-docs/src/consts.ts`, so neither the build nor CI needs credentials, and
pull requests from forks build normally. `packages/dacha-docs/media/` is the gitignored
local working copy, synced by `npm run docs:media:push` / `docs:media:pull`
(`packages/dacha-docs/scripts/media.mjs`, an `aws s3 sync` wrapper — it needs
`S3_DOCS_BUCKET`, `S3_ENDPOINT` and optionally `S3_DOCS_PROFILE` from `.env.local`). **Images are the opposite** — screenshots and posters belong in
`packages/dacha-docs/src/assets/`, committed, so they diff alongside the prose they
illustrate and go through the `astro:assets` optimizer. `npm run check:media -w dacha-docs`
runs in the docs workflow and fails the build on an unreachable media URL, which
starlight's link validator does not cover.

**Documentation prose has a style guide — [packages/dacha-docs/STYLE.md](packages/dacha-docs/STYLE.md).**
Read it before writing or editing anything under `packages/dacha-docs/src/content/docs/`. The
short version: the reader is a developer who may not be a fluent English speaker, so write
short sentences in active voice with concrete verbs, one idea per sentence. Do not chain
clauses with em dashes, and do not reach for the more elegant phrasing when a plainer one says
the same thing. The guide is the authority; this paragraph only points at it.

Run a single test file with `npx jest path/to/file.test.ts` from inside the relevant
package. `npm run dev` is how you see an engine change end-to-end: the TypeScript watcher
recompiles the engine and the editor's webpack picks it up without a manual build.

**Typecheck with `tsc -b` from the root.** Jest (ts-jest, per-file transpile) and eslint
do **not** do a strict whole-project typecheck, so real type errors pass both. If output
looks stale or missing, run `npm run clean` or `tsc -b --force` — `tsc -b` honours
incremental state and will legitimately do nothing when it believes it is up to date.

## Repository layout

```
packages/dacha/              the engine
packages/dacha-workbench/    the editor
packages/dacha-docs/         the documentation site (astro + starlight)
scripts/                     pack-local.js, release.js (plain Node CommonJS, unlinted)
docs/                        local planning material — GITIGNORED, never committed
packs/                       output of pack:local — gitignored
```

Tooling lives once, at the root: `package.json` (npm workspaces), `tsconfig.json`
(solution file with project references), `eslint.config.mjs`, `.prettierrc`, `.husky/`,
`.vscode/`. Do not reintroduce per-package copies of any of these.

TypeScript project references link the two packages: the editor's
`tsconfig.esm.json` references the engine's, and `tsc -b` builds them in order.

### tsconfig settings that look removable and are not

These were each established empirically; removing any of them breaks the build in a way
tests do not catch:

- `packages/dacha/tsconfig.esm.json` → `"types": ["jest"]`. Not `node` (clashes with
  `lib.dom` over `TextEncoder`/`TextDecoder`), not empty (test helpers outside the
  `**/*.test.ts` mask compile into the published package and call bare `expect`).
- Both `tsconfig.esm.json` files → `"rootDir": "./src"`. Without it `composite` emits to
  `build/src/…` and every declared entry point in `package.json` breaks.
- `packages/dacha-workbench/tsconfig.esm.json` → explicit `include` with `src/**/*.json`,
  because `app.tsx` imports `view/locales/en.json` and the default include does not match
  `.json`.
- Both packages' `build:clean` → must delete `tsconfig.esm.tsbuildinfo`. It lives beside
  the package manifest, not in the output directory, so a clean that misses it leaves tsc
  believing the project is up to date; since `build` is also `prepublishOnly`, that would
  publish an empty tarball.

# The engine — packages/dacha

## Architecture

An **ECS-flavored** design:

- **Component** — plain data attached to an actor (position, sprite, collider, …). Every
  component class has a static `componentName`. Core in
  [packages/dacha/src/engine/component/](packages/dacha/src/engine/component/), built-ins
  in [packages/dacha/src/contrib/components/](packages/dacha/src/contrib/components/).
- **Actor** — the main entity
  ([src/engine/actor/actor.ts](packages/dacha/src/engine/actor/actor.ts)). Holds
  components, supports parent/child hierarchy, always created with a `Transform`. Actors
  can be instantiated from **templates**.
- **System** — the logic units
  ([src/engine/system/system.ts](packages/dacha/src/engine/system/system.ts)). Every
  system class has a static `systemName`. Two kinds:
  - `WorldSystem` — global, persists across scene changes (rendering, input, audio). Extra
    lifecycle: `onWorldLoad`, `onWorldReady`, `onWorldDestroy`.
  - `SceneSystem` — created and destroyed with a scene (game logic, AI).
  - Shared hooks: `onSceneLoad` (async, load resources), `onSceneEnter`, `onSceneExit`,
    `onSceneDestroy`, `update` (variable timestep), `fixedUpdate` (fixed timestep).
- **Scene** — a level/menu/state, a container of actors
  ([src/engine/scene/scene.ts](packages/dacha/src/engine/scene/scene.ts)).
- **World** — root container of all scenes, exposes the `systemApi` registry
  ([src/engine/world/](packages/dacha/src/engine/world/)).
- **Entity** — shared base ([src/engine/entity/](packages/dacha/src/engine/entity/))
  providing the hierarchy and event-target behaviour Actor/Scene/World build on.
- **Engine** — [src/engine/engine.ts](packages/dacha/src/engine/engine.ts). Constructed
  with `{ config, systems, components, assets, resources? }`. Lifecycle `play()` /
  `pause()` / `stop()`; `play()` requires `config.startSceneId` and validates that every
  component and system has its static name.

**Game loop** — [src/engine/game-loop.ts](packages/dacha/src/engine/game-loop.ts): a
fixed-timestep loop via `requestAnimationFrame`, with variable-rate `update()` and
fixed-rate `fixedUpdate()`. Defaults in
[src/engine/consts.ts](packages/dacha/src/engine/consts.ts): `fixedUpdateRate` 50 Hz,
`maxFPS` uncapped, `maxFrameDelta` 250 ms, `maxFixedUpdatesPerFrame` 5. Tunable per game
via `PerformanceSettings` in `globalOptions`.

**Querying actors** — systems find actors via `ActorQuery` / `ActorCollection`
([src/engine/actor/](packages/dacha/src/engine/actor/)), filtered by components, e.g.
`new ActorQuery({ scene, filter: [Transform, Velocity] })`.

**Events** — actors, scenes and the world are event targets. Events are queued and
dispatched through a shared `eventQueue`
([src/engine/event-target/](packages/dacha/src/engine/event-target/)); there is also
`dispatchEventImmediately` for synchronous delivery. Type maps (`WorldEventMap`,
`SceneEventMap`, `ActorEventMap`) live in
[src/types/events](packages/dacha/src/types/events).

## Layout

- **src/engine/** — the framework-agnostic core (actor, component, system, scene, world,
  entity, template, asset, game-loop, math-lib, data-lib, resource-loader, time).
- **src/contrib/** — batteries-included pieces built on the core:
  - `systems/`: `renderer` (pixi.js), `physics-system`, `animator`, `audio-system`,
    `behavior-system`, `camera-system`, `character-controller`, `interpolator`,
    `keyboard-input-system` / `keyboard-control-system`, `mouse-input-system` /
    `mouse-control-system`, `game-stats-meter`, `ui-bridge`.
  - `components/`: `transform`, `sprite`, `bitmap-text`, `mesh`, `pixi-view`, `camera`,
    `collider`, `rigid-body`, `character-body`, `shape`, `animatable`, `audio-source`,
    `behaviors`, `interpolation`, `keyboard-control`, `mouse-control`.
  - `assets/`: built-in asset kinds (`texture`, `audio`, `bitmapFont`).
- **src/events/**, **src/types/** — shared engine events and types.
- **src/index.ts** — the public API barrel. Subpath exports exist for `dacha/events`,
  `dacha/renderer`, `dacha/physics` (see `exports` in its `package.json`).

## Conventions

- **TypeScript strict**, `module: ESNext`, `moduleResolution: Bundler`. ESM output only —
  the package has no `"type": "module"`, so it is consumed by bundlers, not by Node
  directly.
- Public classes and methods carry **TSDoc** with `@category` for typedoc grouping; match
  that style when adding public API.
- Tests are colocated in `tests/` folders beside the code they cover.
- A component or system is unusable without its static `componentName`/`systemName` — the
  engine throws at `play()`.
- `npm run docs -w dacha` regenerates the typedoc output into `packages/dacha/docs/`
  (gitignored). It stays a package script rather than a root one because only the engine
  publishes API docs. Its `typedoc.json` deliberately points at `tsconfig.esm.json`: the
  base config carries `types: ["jest", "node"]` for the tests, and `@types/node` clashes
  with `lib.dom` (TS2430), so documenting the build config both fixes that and documents
  exactly the published surface.

# The editor — packages/dacha-workbench

## Two processes — keep them straight

This is an Electron app, so code crosses process boundaries. **When editing, know which
side you are on:**

- **Main process (Node)** — [index.js](packages/dacha-workbench/index.js) is the Electron
  entry: creates the `BrowserWindow`, runs an Express server for the renderer and project
  assets, wires IPC. Supporting modules live in
  **[electron/](packages/dacha-workbench/electron/)**: file system access, menus, native
  dialogs, project config load and watch, persistent storage, and
  **electron/script-templates/** — the scaffolding used to generate new
  components/systems/behaviors/shaders/filter-effects in the user's project. IPC message
  names are centralised in
  [electron/messages.js](packages/dacha-workbench/electron/messages.js).
- **Renderer process (React)** — everything under
  **[src/](packages/dacha-workbench/src/)**, entry
  [src/app.tsx](packages/dacha-workbench/src/app.tsx).
- **CLI** — [bin/index.js](packages/dacha-workbench/bin/index.js) (commander): the single
  default command launches the editor, taking `--config` (default
  `dacha-workbench.config.js`). In dev it spawns the `electron` CLI, in prod the packaged
  binary. Scaffolding a new project is `create-dacha`'s job, not this CLI's — the `init`
  subcommand was removed when the template landed. `postinstall` runs
  `bin/install.js`, which packages the Electron app — set `DACHA_SKIP_APP_BUILD=1` to skip
  that when only the library part matters.

`npm start -w dacha-workbench` runs the editor against the sample project in
[fixture/](packages/dacha-workbench/fixture/); prefer the root `npm run dev`, which also
watches the engine.

## Renderer architecture (src/)

- **app.tsx** — bootstraps React, i18next (locales in `src/view/locales/`),
  `reflect-metadata`, antd reset CSS, and mounts `<App/>` inside a deep stack of context
  providers (theme, command, command-scope, hotkeys, engine, entity-explorer,
  notification, needs-reload).
- **Store / command pattern** — `src/store/`:
  - `Store` (`store.ts`) holds the project `Data` tree and notifies listeners on
    `set`/`delete` by path (`string[]`).
  - `CommanderStore` (`commander-store.ts`) wraps it with **undo/redo history** (size 100)
    and scoped commands. All mutations go through commands — `setValue`, `addValue`,
    `deleteValue` in `src/store/commands/`. **Mutate project state through commands, never
    by touching `Store` directly**, or undo/redo and effects break.
- **View** — `src/view/`: `modules/` holds the major panels (`explorer`, `inspector`,
  `toolbar`, `bottom-bar`, `settings-modal`); `providers/` the React contexts; `hooks/`
  (`useExtension`, `useConfig`, `useCommander`, `useStore`, `useBehaviors`); plus
  `components/`, `themes/`, `locales/`, `common-styles/`, `commands/`. Styling via
  **@emotion** (`*.style.ts`) and **antd**, drag and drop via **@dnd-kit**.
- **Decorators** — `src/decorators/`: the library-facing API a game project uses to
  register its engine extensions with the editor — `DefineComponent`, `DefineSystem`,
  `DefineBehavior`, `DefineAsset`, `DefineField`, `DefineShader`, `DefineFilterEffect`.
  They use `reflect-metadata` to attach names and schemas and register widgets in
  `schemaRegistry` / `class-registry`, gated by `isEditor()`. Exported via the
  `dacha-workbench/decorators` subpath.
- **Engine integration** — `src/engine/`: builds the dacha `Config` the editor runs
  (`config.ts` → `getEditorConfig`), plus editor-only components and systems layered on
  the real engine for the editing surface (pointer/hand/zoom/template tools, selection).
- **Public API** — `src/index.ts` re-exports the inspector field widgets (`Field`,
  `TextInput`, `NumberInput`, `Select`, `ColorInput`, `FileInput`, …), the `commands`
  object, hooks, `defineWidget`, providers and widget-schema types.

## Conventions

- **Renderer (`src/`)**: TypeScript strict, React function components, emotion + antd,
  i18n via `react-i18next` — never hardcode user-facing strings, add them to
  `src/view/locales/`.
- **Main and CLI (`electron/`, `bin/`)**: plain Node CommonJS, no TypeScript. Excluded
  from linting, like `scripts/` at the root.
- **Tests** colocated in `tests/` folders; jsdom environment, Testing Library, and a
  `FixJSDOMEnvironment.js` shim. Integration tests are separate: Playwright specs in
  `e2e/` that launch the real Electron app (see **Commands** for `.env.local` setup).
- Two build toolchains: **webpack** for the runnable app, **tsc** (`tsconfig.esm.json`)
  for the `esm/` library export. `webpack.extension.config.js` builds the project's own
  code as an extension bundle, and it externalises `dacha-workbench*` to
  `window.DachaWorkbench` so registries stay single instances.
- Keep the **main/renderer boundary** clean — the renderer reaches native capabilities
  only through IPC messages defined in `electron/messages.js`.

---

## Working agreements

- Do **not** auto-commit. Implement and verify, then let the user review and commit —
  including merges, tags and pushes. This holds for every task, plan-driven or not.
- Do not publish. `npm run release` is the user's command to run.
- `docs/` is gitignored local planning material (specs, plans, execution ledgers). Read it
  for context, but nothing there is part of the repository.
