description: "Replace a component's generated inspector panel with a React component of your own."
---

The [field decorator](/game-code/inspector-fields/) generates a panel: one labelled input
per field, top to bottom. That covers most components. When it stops being enough, you
replace the whole panel with a component of your own.

The editor is a React application, so a widget is a React component. That is the one place
where the editor's own stack reaches into your project. Your game is untouched by it, and if
you never write a widget you never import React.

A widget is worth the effort when the panel has to show something the values alone do not
say. A preview of what the settings produce, a number that would otherwise be worked out on
paper, a control that writes several fields at once, a list whose rows have their own shape.
If the panel only needs different labels or a different order, stay with fields.

## The file

A widget lives in a file named `*.widget.tsx` and registers itself by the name of the class it
draws:

```tsx
import { useState, type FC } from 'react';
import {
  defineWidget,
  Widget,
  LabelledSelect,
  useConfig,
  useCommander,
  commands,
} from 'dacha-workbench';
import type { WidgetProps } from 'dacha-workbench';

const PRESETS: Record<string, { points: number; armour: number }> = {
  grunt: { points: 30, armour: 0 },
  brute: { points: 200, armour: 5 },
};

const HealthWidget: FC<WidgetProps> = ({ path, fields, sections }) => {
  const { dispatch } = useCommander();
  const [preset, setPreset] = useState<string | null>(null);

  const points = useConfig(path.concat('points')) as number;

  const applyPreset = (name: string | null): void => {
    setPreset(name);

    const values = name ? PRESETS[name] : undefined;
    if (!values) {
      return;
    }

    dispatch(commands.setValue(path.concat('points'), values.points));
    dispatch(commands.setValue(path.concat('armour'), values.armour, true));
  };

  return (
    <>
      <LabelledSelect
        label="Preset"
        value={preset}
        allowEmpty
        options={[
          { title: 'Grunt', value: 'grunt' },
          { title: 'Brute', value: 'brute' },
        ]}
        onChange={applyPreset}
      />

      <Widget path={path} fields={fields} sections={sections} />

      <p>Dies in {Math.ceil(points / 10)} hits from the starting weapon.</p>
    </>
  );
};

defineWidget('Health')(HealthWidget);
```

Three things in that file are worth pointing at.

**The name passed to `defineWidget` is the component's name**, the same string
`@DefineComponent` was given. That is the only link between the two. Systems and behaviors work
the same way, so a widget can replace their panels too.

**There is no default export.** Unlike a component or a system, a widget file is imported for
its side effect. The call to `defineWidget` is the registration, and the editor never looks for
an export.

**`<Widget/>` draws the fields you declared.** You are not obliged to hand-write every input.
Render it where you want the generated part to sit, and put your own controls around it.

The `fields` and `sections` the widget receives are its own schema, handed back to it. That is
what makes the line above work, and it is also how you draw one field on its own:

```tsx
<Field {...fields[0]} path={path} />
```

`WidgetProps` carries a `context` as well. The editor uses it for its own nested panels, such
as the one drawn for a behavior inside the `Behaviors` list. A widget in a project passes it
through or ignores it.

## What a widget is actually editing

Not a component. There is no `Health` instance behind the panel, and nothing in the inspector
holds one. What a widget edits is the project's configuration, the same JSON the engine will
later build the component from. The editor keeps that configuration in one store, and every
panel is a view onto a part of it.

`path` is the address of this component's part, as an array of keys:

```tsx
['scenes', 'id:8f2a', 'actors', 'id:31c0', 'components', 'name:Health', 'config']
```

Most segments are ordinary object keys. A segment that indexes into an array can be a number,
or a `field:value` lookup that finds the entry whose field holds that value. The lookup form
is what the editor uses for anything a person can reorder, because an index stops meaning the
same thing the moment a list is sorted.

You rarely build a path from scratch. You extend the one you were given, which is what
`path.concat('points')` does above. Building one from the root is for reaching somewhere else
in the project, such as the sorting layers a field wants to
[offer as options](/game-code/inspector-fields/#options-that-depend-on-the-project).

## Reading and writing values

`useConfig(path)` reads the value at a path and subscribes to it. The widget re-renders when
that value changes, whoever changed it: your own dispatch, another panel, an undo.

Writes go through a command:

```tsx
dispatch(commands.setValue(path.concat('points'), 120));
```

`setValue` replaces a value, `addValue` appends to a list, and `deleteValue` removes an entry.

It matters that these are commands rather than assignments. The editor never writes into the
configuration directly. Each command applies the change and hands back the function that
reverses it, and the store keeps that pair on an undo stack a hundred entries deep. Undo
walks that stack backwards and redo walks it forwards. So a value written through a command
is a value that can be taken back, and a value written any other way is not.

Assigning into the object you read from `useConfig` looks like it works and fails twice over.
The change cannot be undone, because nothing recorded how to reverse it. And nothing
re-renders, because the store notifies its listeners from inside `set`, and you went around
it.

### Several writes, one undo

The preset in the example writes two fields. Left alone that would be two entries on the undo
stack, and one undo would leave half a preset behind.

Passing `true` as the third argument attaches a change to the previous one instead of starting
a new entry:

```tsx
dispatch(commands.setValue(path.concat('points'), values.points));
dispatch(commands.setValue(path.concat('armour'), values.armour, true));
```

Undo now reverses both, in reverse order, as one step. The first write in a group is always
the plain one. Every write after it carries the flag.

## Reusing the editor's inputs

The editor exports the inputs it uses itself, so a custom panel looks like the rest of the
application without any styling work:

| Export | Draws |
| --- | --- |
| `Widget` | The whole generated field list |
| `Field` | One declared field, by its schema |
| `Section` | A collapsible group |
| `LabelledNumberInput`, `LabelledTextInput`, `LabelledSelect`, `LabelledCheckbox`, `LabelledColorInput`, `LabelledFileInput`, `LabelledVectorInput`, `LabelledTextArea`, `LabelledMultiTextInput`, `LabelledMultiSelect` | One input with its label |
| `MultiField` | An editable list of name and value pairs |

Each labelled input has an unlabelled twin under the same name without the prefix, for when you
lay out the label yourself.

## Saving the file reloads it

You do not restart the editor to see a widget change. Saving the file rebuilds the extension
bundle, and the editor then drops the old script, empties its widget and schema registries,
loads the new bundle, and redraws the inspector with it.

One consequence is worth knowing before it surprises you. That reload also re-checks the saved
configuration against the current schemas. If the check has to fix anything, which is what
happens when you add a field to a component, the editor clears the undo history along with it.
Work you wanted to undo, undo before you save a schema change.

## How the file reaches the editor

The editor compiles your project's widgets into a separate bundle and loads it into the
inspector. Two details of that bundle matter to you.

The widgets are collected before the components. So by the time `@DefineComponent` runs and
asks the registry whether a widget exists for `Health`, yours is already there. The order is
guaranteed, and you do not have to arrange it.

And `dacha-workbench` is external to the bundle. Your import resolves to the running editor's
own copy, not to a second one, which is what keeps the registries and the React tree single.
Import from `dacha-workbench` and let the editor supply it.

This is also why a widget never reaches your game. The `*.widget.tsx` suffix is not in the
globs your game's entry point uses, and nothing in the game imports the file. See
[how scripts are found](/game-code/auto-registration/).

## Fields still matter

A widget replaces the panel, not the schema. Keep declaring fields, because they are what
decides the shape of the saved configuration, what fills in the initial values for a new
component, and what the editor writes into actors that already exist when you add a field
later.

The `data` field type exists for exactly this pairing: a value your widget maintains and
saves, which no generated input should draw. See
[choosing the widget](/game-code/inspector-fields/#choosing-the-widget).
